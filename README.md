 <h1>ADVANCED PROGRAMMING FOR AI ASSIGNMENT</h1>
 <h4>Compare different loss functions for regression problems. Define a set of simple
    regression problems, implement a set of baseline network architectures and
    compare different loss functions under fair comparison conditions (initialization,
    number of epochs, ...)</h4>

<h3>The code and the explanation is reported step by step in <i>assignment.ipynb</i> file.</h3>
